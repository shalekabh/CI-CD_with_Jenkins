# What is Jenkins and its stages

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes. It provides a platform for automating the building, testing, and deployment of software applications. Jenkins offers a vast array of plugins and integrations, making it highly customizable and adaptable to various development environments.

Stages in Jenkins refer to the different steps or phases in a CI/CD pipeline. A pipeline in Jenkins is defined using a Jenkinsfile, which is a text file that describes the entire CI/CD process as a series of stages and steps. Each stage represents a distinct phase of the pipeline, and within each stage, you can define one or more steps to be executed.

Here are some commonly used stages in Jenkins pipelines:

Checkout: This stage involves checking out the source code from a version control system, such as Git or Subversion, to perform further operations on it.

Build: In this stage, the application code is compiled, built, and packaged. It can involve tasks like compiling source code, running unit tests, generating artifacts, and creating build artifacts.

Test: The test stage focuses on executing various types of tests to ensure the quality and correctness of the application. This includes unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and any other tests that validate the behavior of the application.

Deploy: This stage involves deploying the built artifacts to the target environment, such as a staging or production server. It can include tasks like deploying to a web server, provisioning infrastructure, configuring services, and setting up databases.

Publish: The publish stage typically involves generating reports, documentation, and other artifacts that provide insights into the build and test results. This stage may also involve publishing artifacts to artifact repositories or making them available for download.

Notify: In this stage, notifications or alerts are sent out to relevant parties, such as developers, QA teams, or stakeholders, to provide information about the build status or any issues encountered during the pipeline execution....
